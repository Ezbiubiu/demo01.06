**Annotation
We have learnt to use Github and improve our group work effciency which madde use experienced a hard time. Fortunately, 
we have grouped our work together but still missed several functions we have designed adnd worked for hours. 
We think our Beta game will be a perfect one.
The burn ddown chart has 6 hours left because the "Main Menu" and "save game" parts have not been added to the game, 
but we have both of those parts almost ready. Our original working list has 86 hours in total, but our actuall working time 
is way more than what we planed. We appologize that we did not able to make the plan accurate.
